          <p class="post-text">
              The intense scent and oil in basil and many other herbs are often used to deter common household pests. Basil may smell delicious to us when it's used in a zesty tomato sauce, but it smells terrible to bugs
              <br><b>Botanical name:</b> <i>Ocimum basilicum</i>
              <br><b>Benefits:</b> The pungent herb seems to repel flies and basil pest control has been used since ancient times.

          <p class="post-text">
              Marigolds are downright beautiful, and though my family has always planted them, I didn't know they were bug repellants. It is indeed an aethestic flower as they are used in large amounts in "Pooja" and Temples.
              <br><b>Botanical name:</b> <i>Tagetes</i>

          <p class="post-text">
              Many people have enjoyed the pleasing fragrance of lavender and used it to treat a variety of conditions. People say its uses range from helping them calm down and get a good night’s sleep. As someone who's grown lavender and has pollen allergies, I suggest growing a lavender bush on your porch or balcony rather than full-on bringing it into the house.
              <br><b>Botanical name:</b> <i>Lavandula</i>
              <br><b>Benefits:</b></b>  lavender oil can help you slay infestations of fleas, black beetles, and several types of flies.

          <p class="post-text">
              Your cats are about to be incredibly happy. Believe it or not, catnip appears to be excellent at keeping bugs, including mosquitoes, at bay.
           <br><b>Botanical name:</b> <i> Nepeta Cataria</i>
              <br><b>Benefits:</b> Nepetalactone, the essential oil in catnip that gives the plant its characteristic odor, is about ten times more effective at repelling mosquitoes

          <p class="post-text">
              It is important to know, however, that citronella plants, unlike some of the others on this list, don't just repel mosquitoes by sitting there; you have to crush a leaf yourself in order to free that familiar citronella fragrance for it to be effective.
              <br><b>Botanical name:</b> <i>Cymbopogon nardus</i>

          <p class="post-text">
              Rosemary is a fragrant evergreen herb native to the Mediterranean. It is used as a culinary condiment, to make bodily perfumes, and for its potential health benefits. Rosemary is a member of the mint family Lamiaceae, along with many other herbs, such as oregano, thyme, basil, and lavender. 
              <br><b>Botanical name:</b> <i>Salvia rosmarinus</i>
              <br><b>Benefits:</b> burning rosemary gives off a strong, herby scent that will dissuade insect visitors from sticking around

          <h1 class="post-title">Floss flower (Bluemink)</h1>
          <p class="post-text">
              These small, flowering plants produce blue, pink and white blooms in the summer and fall. They work well in rock gardens, flower beds or as an edging plant. Floss flowers like really fertile soil, so you may want to fertilize them.
              <br><b>Botanical name:</b> <i>Ageratum houstonianum</i>
              <br><b>Benefits:</b> contain coumarin, a chemical used in bug repellent sprays. Mosquitoes don't like the smell of the chemical

          <h1 class="post-title">Sage plant</h1>
          <p class="post-text">
              Like rosemary, sage is a perennial plant that can be grown in planters on a patio or planted into landscaped beds. If you're camping or making s'mores in the backyard, toss a little sage or rosemary into the fire.
              <br><b>Botanical name:</b> <i>Salvia officinalis</i>
              <br><b>Benefits:</b> The scented smoke helps keep away unwanted insects. You can make a bug repellant spray using sage, too.

            <p class="post-text">
              One of the common mosquito repellent plants in India has to be a garlic plant. Garlic is another way to avoid mosquitoes. You can utilize it by cutting it in little pieces and spreading it around your living rooms. You can also make a spray using garlic. 
                <br><b>Botanical name:</b> <i>Allium Sativum</i>
                <br><b>Benefits:</b> Blend it with aromatic oils to make a mosquito repulsing spray or just grow a garlic plant in your balcony or porch.
